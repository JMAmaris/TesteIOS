* Represent information returned in list mode and detail mode.
* From the detail mode it should be possible to access a map view and a dedicated view of photos.
* It should be possible to browse the details of multiple ads using a UIPageViewController.
* From the list mode, it should be able to share information of each ad.
* There must be a way to persist the received data.
